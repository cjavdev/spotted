      #   You can narrow down your search using field filters. The available filters are
      #   `album`, `artist`, `track`, `year`, `upc`, `tag:hipster`, `tag:new`, `isrc`, and
      #   `genre`. Each field filter only applies to certain result types.
      #
      #   The `artist` and `year` filters can be used while searching albums, artists and
      #   tracks. You can filter on a single `year` or a range (e.g. 1955-1960).<br /> The
      #   `album` filter can be used while searching albums and tracks.<br /> The `genre`
      #   filter can be used while searching artists and tracks.<br /> The `isrc` and
      #   `track` filters can be used while searching tracks.<br /> The `upc`, `tag:new`
      #   and `tag:hipster` filters can only be used while searching albums. The `tag:new`
      #   filter will return albums released in the past two weeks and `tag:hipster` can
      #   be used to return only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.<br />
